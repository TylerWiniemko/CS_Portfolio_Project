# CS_Portfolio_Project

## Grocery Tracker
This project is a grocery item tracker that is able to read the list of grocery items from a file. This can count the frequency of the items and it allows for the user to search for items and see a list of it as well.

## What I did well
I used a clean and modular class design for the GroceryTracker. I used C++ structures to manage and store the item frequencies. I also added a backup file to ensure the safety of the data that was implemented by the user.

## Areas for Improvement
One area of improvement would be my input validation and my case sensitivity. As of right now when searching for items the search must be an exact match. It can not be a close relation it would have to directly match the inquiry which is not exactly the most user friendly. Making it to where case sensitivity is not an issue for searching could be a solid improvment.

## Challenges and how I overcame them
The most challenging part I faced was handling the file input and output correctly to make sure that the data was accurate in between sessions.

## Transferable skills
The skills that I gained from this project includes a good standard practice of the C++ library like ifstream, map, and ofstream. Other skills would include the design and writing of the code. Making a user friendly application that someone could use without too much difficulty. 

## Making the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable
I made sure that the project had maintainability by using a dedicated class and using clear naming conventions. I added modular functions that could make future updates and I added comments to the codes structure so that it would be understandable and readable.
